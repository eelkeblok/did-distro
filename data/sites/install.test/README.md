This directory is here so that you can set up a site to easily test installs
while also having a development site. If you need more information on how to do
that, refer to the [Drupal Multisite documentation][1]. Note that the Drupal 8
documentation is limited at the time of writing, but the principles remain the
as they were for [Drupal 7][2].
